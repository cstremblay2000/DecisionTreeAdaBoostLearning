# DecisionTreeAdaBoostLearning
Implementation of Decision Tree Learning and AdaBoost

---

# Description
This program uses two separate kinds of machine learning to tell the difference between dutch and english. It uses Descision Tree learning, and then AdaBoost powered by Descision Stumps. The algorithm looks for differences in the languages such as presence of certain definite article, certain combinations of letters, and other semantic differences to train the model. Once the model is created it can be fed input and will spit out what language the model thinks it is.
